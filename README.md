# flower-classifier

This Project is an application of Machine Learning with python programming.

- It focuses on Flower classification using deep learning concepts and machine learning algorithms.
- The goal was to apply Deep learning techniques to train a flower classifier to recognize different species of flowers. Flower recognition uses the edge and colour characteristics of flower images to classify flowers.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

1. Load and preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier on your dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content
